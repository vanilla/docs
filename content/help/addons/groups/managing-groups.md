## Adding your first groups

After enabling the Groups addon, "Groups" will appear in your top-level navigation. In a customized theme, this may not be the case and you'll need to go directly to the URL "/groups" from your forum domain (e.g. "yoursite.vanillaforums.com/groups").

As the administrator, click the "New Group" button near the top of the page. The "Icon" image shows on the groups lists. The "Banner" is the large image at the top of your group's page.

## Editing and deleting groups

From the groups list, use the options (gear) dropdown menu next to each group to edit or delete them. Any edits are applied immediately. Deleting a group is irreversible and deletes its discussions as well.

## Editing the members list and assigning Leaders

Click "Members" at the bottom of the group's page to see a list of everyone who is currently in the group. From this list, you can promote group members to "Leaders". Leaders have the ability to manage the group's members and edit the group's settings, events, and discussions. The group's creator cannot have their leader status removed.

If you need the owner of a group reassigned, contact support.
