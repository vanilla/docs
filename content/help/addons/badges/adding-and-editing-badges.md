## Disabling badges

To disable a badge and prevent it from displaying publicly, click "Yes" in the badge's row under the "Active" column. That will toggle it to "No", indicating it is no longer active.  Inactive badges remain awarded to any users that received it previously. You can re-enable them by clicking "No", which will then toggle back to "Yes", indicating it is active again.

It is not currently possible to delete a badge entirely.

## Editing a badge

You can safely edit the Name, Description, and/or Image of any badge without effecting its automated functionality. These will be updated for any users who previously received the badge as well.

The "Slug" field is what shows in the URL for the badge's page. It is its unique identifier. Changing a badge's Slug will cause it to be disassociated with any automation assigned to it. Therefore, *do not change the Slug of the Badges that come with Vanilla by default*.

You may change the Points for a badge at any time. Point changes are not retroactive for users who previously received it.

## Creating your own badges

Create a memorable Name for your badge and give it a Description that explains what it is for and how users can earn it. This information will appear on the Badge's page.

The Slug should consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The Slug must be unique for each badge.

Add a 200x200 PNG for the image.

All badges created in your Dashboard must be given manually.

## Creating automated badges

It is not currently possible to create your own automated badges thru the Dashboard. To discuss custom possibilities for your community, contact sales.
