Facebook Connect allows users to sign in using their Facebook account. You must register your application with Facebook for this plugin to work.

### How to set up Facebook Connect

In order to set up Facebook Connect, you must create an "application" in Facebook at: [https://developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)

Once your application has been set up, you must copy the "Application ID" and "Application Secret" into your Facebook plugin settings page from your Vanilla dashboard.
